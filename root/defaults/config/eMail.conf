# Config file for sSMTP sendmail
# (Gmail example)
#

# The person who gets all mail

# The place where the mail goes. The actual machine name is required no
# MX records are consulted. Commonly mailhosts are named mail.domain.com
mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:465

# NO - Use the system generated From: address
FromLineOverride=YES

# Use SSL/TLS before starting negotiation
#TLS_CA_FILE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
UseTLS=YES
#UseSTARTTLS=Yes

# Authentication
AuthUser=USER@gmail.com
AuthPass=PASSWORD


#### VERY IMPORTANT !!! If other people have access to this computer
# Your GMAIL Password is left unencrypted in this file
# so make sure you have a strong root password!
#
#
#    If your Gmail account is secured with two-factor authentication, you need to generate a unique App Password
#    to use in ssmtp.conf. You can do so on your App Passwords page. Use you Gmail username (not the App Name)
#    in the AuthUser line and use the generated 16-character password in the AuthPass line, spaces in the password
#    can be omitted.
#    If you do not use two-factor authentication, you need to allow access to unsecure apps.
#    You can do so on your Less Secure Apps page.
#
#
# send a test mail:
# user@yourmachine ~ $ echo "testing ssmtp setup" | sendmail yourMail@gmail.com
